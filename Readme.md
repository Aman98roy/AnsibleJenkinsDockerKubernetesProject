# DevOps CI/CD Pipeline with Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes

## Overview
Our DevOps Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is a robust and efficient solution that streamlines software development and delivery using cutting-edge technologies. This pipeline leverages Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Ansible for configuration management, Jenkins for CI/CD orchestration, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for seamless deployment orchestration.

## Technologies Used
- Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool to manage cloud resources and infrastructure components.
- Ansible: Powerful automation tool for configuring servers and applications.
- Jenkins: Automation server for building, testing, and deploying applications.
- Docker: Containerization platform for packaging applications and dependencies.
- Kubernetes: Container orchestration platform for scalable and resilient deployments.

## How It Works
1. Terraform provisions and manages infrastructure as code, ensuring consistency and reducing errors.
2. Ansible handles configuration management, maintaining the desired state of servers and applications.
3. Jenkins automates the CI/CD process, triggering builds, running tests, and deploying to various environments.
4. Docker containerizes applications, ensuring consistent environments and simplified deployments.
5. Kubernetes orchestrates containerized applications, providing scalability and high availability.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install necessary dependencies for Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes.
3. Customize the configurations in the Terraform and Ansible files to match your infrastructure and application requirements.
4. Set up Jenkins pipelines for your projects and configure Docker and Kubernetes integration.
5. Run the pipeline, and watch your applications being continuously integrated, tested, and deployed.
